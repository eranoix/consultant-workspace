/**
 * Availability: turning rules into the slots a person can actually pick.
 *
 * The naive version of this is a loop over opening hours that subtracts
 * bookings. It falls apart on the cases that make up most of real scheduling:
 *
 *   - A service that runs 50 minutes but is offered on the hour, so the gap
 *     between appointments is part of the rule, not a rounding error.
 *   - Notice periods: "not in the next two hours" is different from "not
 *     today", and both are different from "not before Monday".
 *   - Exceptions that ADD availability, not only remove it. A Saturday morning
 *     opened for one week is the same shape of data as a Tuesday closed for a
 *     holiday, and modelling only the second one means the first gets hacked in
 *     later.
 *   - Days that are not 24 hours long, because the clocks moved.
 *
 * All times here are UTC instants (epoch milliseconds). Local wall-clock rules
 * are resolved against a named zone at the edge of this module and never
 * carried inward, because a "09:00" that has already been turned into an
 * instant is unambiguous, and one that has not is a bug waiting for October.
