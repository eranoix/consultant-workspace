/**
 * Recurrence, deliberately small.
 *
 * This covers daily, weekly-by-weekday and monthly-by-day-of-month, with a
 * count or an until, plus exception dates. That is a subset of RFC 5545, and
 * the subset is the point: the full specification includes rules almost nobody
 * schedules against, and every one of them is a branch that can be wrong.
 *
 * Two decisions worth stating, because both are where naive implementations
 * quietly produce the wrong answer:
 *
 *   Expansion walks the LOCAL calendar, not a fixed millisecond step. A weekly
 *   series across a daylight-saving boundary must keep landing at 09:00 local;
 *   adding 7 × 86_400_000 lands it at 08:00 or 10:00 and nobody notices until
 *   someone misses an appointment.
 *
 *   The 31st of a month that has 30 days is SKIPPED, not clamped to the 30th.
 *   Clamping silently invents an occurrence the person never asked for, and
 *   the difference shows up as a stranger in someone's calendar.
